Description: A collection of data processing tools and helper primarily motivated by remote sensing forestry related applications. 
        This is a companion package to the RForInvt package, where this package supports the remote sensing related operations and
        RForInvt focuses on forest inventory task such as modeling and estimation. The motivation to separate the two sets of functionalities
        is that this package has so many dependencies that it can be difficult to build.
        Notable functionality is running FUSION lidar proecessing tools especially raster <-> .dtm (FUSION raster), gridmetrics, 
        treeseg, canopyModel, and a package specific project format that manages lidar tile overlap with .dtm files for 
        large areas. This functionality is similar to areaprocessor (FUSION) or catalogs (lidR) but works with FUSION and
        can handle huge areas.
